The [Crowbar Framework](https://github.com/dellcloudedge/crowbar) was developed
by the [Dell CloudEdge Solutions Team](http://dell.com/openstack) as an
[OpenStack](http://OpenStack.org) installer, but has evolved as a much broader
function tool.

A Barclamp is a module component that implements functionality for Crowbar.
Core barclamps operate the essential functions of the Crowbar deployment
mechanics while other barclamps extend the system for specific applications.

    The functonality of this barclamp DOES NOT stand alone, the Crowbar Framework is required.
